            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Area</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the data is broken down into pieces that are areas, each depicting one of the 50 states on the map of the US and how they would look if just women had voted in 2016.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Line</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the distribution of votes between Clinton and Trump is showcased via a line mark as part of the line bar above the map.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Points</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the data at the bottom of visualization that depicts the electoral vote results incorporates points to show the data. The points represent each candidate that was elected.</li>
                <ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Color</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the two political parties are represented with differing colors. The states in blue are representative of states that voted for the democratic candidate, Clinton, while the states in red are representative of states that voted for the republican candidate, Trump. At the same time, the one state with a mix of the two colors indicates a split in electoral votes for that state. Additionally, the colors explain the situation in Maine and Nebraska with additional context.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the candidates of opposing parties the visualization makes a good choice using color to represent this categorical attribute. In real life, the colors align with the political parties of the candidates, and this makes the visualization more intuitive for the audience.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Length</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>length in the line bar showcases that less women voted blue than red in 2016.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the count of people that voted a certain way the visualization makes a good choice using length to represent this quantitative attribute. It is easy for the audience to conceptualize longer lengths with greater amounts, so this makes the visualization easier to understand.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Shape</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>each state’s shape is important in establishing the different states from one another.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the border of each area of each state the visualization makes a good choice using shape to represent this attribute. Shape is the best way to distinguish between various geographic regions on maps so the audience should be able to easily understand this visualization.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Colormap(s)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Categorical</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red represents the Republican party and blue represents the democratic party</li>
                    <li>This is a good choice because red and blue represent the political parties that the presidential candidates are from, making visualization easy to understand with the categorical color scale</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Points</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the data of the score of batted balls based on the exit velocity and the launch angle is represented in the form of small dots.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Position</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>representing the effect the exit velocity and launch angle have on scoring value, horizontal and vertical positions are leveraged in this visualization.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the launch angle the visualization makes a good choice using the y-axis to represent this divergent attribute. This is a good choice because balls with a greater launch angle go higher in the air, while the opposite is true for balls launched with a smaller launch angle. In showcasing the exit velocity angle the visualization similarly makes a good choice using the x-axis to represent this quantitative attribute. This is a good choice because when velocity is higher the ball tends to go farther and this is visually apparent with the visualization. This is also in line with how humans understand physics variables such as speed, time and distance.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Color</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color is leveraged in this visualization to show whether the scores are below average, above average, or meeting average.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the scoring value the visualization makes a good choice using colors to represent this quantitative attribute. This is a good choice because there are three distinct categories of score values. Looking deeper, each category of score value has varying saturations of their respective hues with more saturated data points indicating higher scores. I think this is also a good choice as it is intuitive for the reader to understand.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Colormap(s)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Divergent</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ordered ordinal attribute</li>
                    <li>This is a good choice because it represents a scale from below average to average to above average where average is white in color and below average is a certain shade of purple depending on how below average it is while above average is a certain shade of orange depending on how aboe average it is. Thus, this visualization is easy to understand with the divergent color scale.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Area</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the number of points each player has scored in their career is represented by the area of the bar above their name.</li>
                <ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Area</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>The number of points scored by each player over the course of their career is represented by the area of the area above their name. The larger the area of their corresponding rectangle, the more points the player has scored.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the points scored by each player the visualization makes a good choice using area to represent the quantitative attribute. This is a good choice because it is intuitive to the audience that a greater size indicates a greater quantity of the attribute, which in this case is points scored.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Color</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Color is leveraged in this visualization to showcase the primary team of each player over the course of their career.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the primary team each player played for the visualization makes a good choice using colors to represent this categorical attribute. This is a good choice because each NBA/ABA team has its own color scheme and colors from the teams are used in the visualization, so the audience can trace the colors to their meanings if they need to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Colormap(s)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Categorical Colormap</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the colors are representative of categories and not a scale or quantity or dichotomy, a categorical colormap is appropriate for this visualization. The colormap is representative of various NBA/ABA teams and accomplishes this by mapping the most well known color of each team onto the bars of the players that team played for.</li>
                    <li>Attribute – in showcasing the primary team each player played for the visualization makes a good choice using a categorical colormap to represent this categorical attribute. This is a good choice because each NBA/ABA team has its own color scheme and colors from the teams are used in the visualization, so the audience can trace the colors to their meanings if they need to.</li>
